##Technical Skills
+	**Software Development** - I'm extremely passionate about developing software.  These are some of the more common technologies I've used in doing so:
	+	**Javascript** - I love it, on the server and the client.  I'm familiar with many client-side libraries and love [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  I find taking a minimalistic approach to webdev can go a long way.
	+	**Go** - Built various Services & APIs using Go.  I've found the strong typing, testability and performance of the language to be great for many use-cases.
	+	**PHP** - I've used many frameworks and libraries such as [Zend](http://framework.zend.com), [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org), [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org), and have architected and written custom frameworks and libraries as well.
	+	**Java** - Two and a half years programming in Java on an enterprise web application. Proficient with [Struts](http://struts.apache.org/), [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/), [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/), and [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/).
	+	**HTML & CSS** - I'm a big fan of semantic markup and modular CSS.  [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) is more.
	+	**Apache** - I'm very famililar with configuring and managing Apache web servers
+	**Databases** - Experienced in [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), [SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/default.aspx), [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/index.html) & [Redis](https://redis.io/), BigQuery, Google Cloud Datastore and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).
+	**Version Control** - [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [SVN](http://subversion.tigris.org/).
+	**Testing** - Strong background and love for unit testing across all languages, from client-side unit tests to backend unit tests.  I find decomposing layers of systems a useful approach to writing good tests.
+	**OS** - Comfortable w/ Mac, Linux & Windows
